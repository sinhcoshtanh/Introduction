- 👋 Hi, I’m @sinhcoshtanh on GitHub
- 👀 I’m interested in:
    * Mathematics, more specifically all forms of [Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus) and [Complex Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number)
    * Healthy domestic privacy practices such as [encryption](https://www.privacytools.io/) and [passwords](https://youtu.be/3NjQ9b3pgIg).
    * Inviting education of Mathematics, as described by Paul Lockhart's [A Mathematician's Lament](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf).
    * Advocacy of free tertiary education.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Stochastic Processes and Statistics](https://study.unimelb.edu.au/find/courses/major/mathematics-and-statistics/what-will-i-study/#sample-plans)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Science related projects for coding projects, and Mathematics, Physics, and Biology teaching ventures.
- :fountain_pen: I'm currently doing whatever I can to better educate people Mathematics. 

> “Students who acquire large debts putting themselves through school are unlikely to think about changing society. When you trap people in a system of debt, they can’t afford the time to think. Tuition fee increases are a disciplinary technique, and, by the time students graduate, they are not only loaded with debt, but have also internalized the disciplinarian culture. This makes them efficient components of the consumer economy.” - Noam Chomsky
